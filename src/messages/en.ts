<p><strong>Effective date:</strong> July 1, 2026</p>

<p>At SAPIOW, respecting your privacy and protecting your personal data is our priority.</p>

<p>This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") is intended to inform you about how your personal data is processed when you use the website <a href="https://sapiow.com/">https://sapiow.com/</a> (the "Website") and/or the Sapiow application (the "Application"), in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (the "GDPR") and French Law No. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 on information technology, data files and civil liberties, as amended (together, the "Applicable Regulations").</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy does not describe how your data is collected and processed via cookies and other trackers ("Cookies") on the Website and/or the Application. For more information, please refer to our Cookie Policy.</p>

<h2><strong>Who is the data controller?</strong></h2>

<p>When you browse and/or register on our Website and/or our Application, or more generally in the context of managing our contractual relationship with you, the data controller is SAPIOW, registered with the Rouen Trade and Companies Register under number 107 277 550, whose registered office is located at La Maison Bleue - 16 rue Alsace Lorraine 76000 Rouen ("We", "Us", "Our").</p>

<h2><strong>What data do we collect?</strong></h2>

<p>Personal data is any information that allows an individual to be identified directly or by cross-referencing with other data.</p>

<p>We collect personal data falling within the following categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identification data (last name, first name, email address, phone number);</li>
  <li>Professional life data (company name, CV, position/job title, LinkedIn URL);</li>
  <li>Social network data (profiles or username);</li>
  <li>Data relating to your purchases on the Website and/or the Application when you are connected with an Expert;</li>
  <li>Connection data (connection logs, encrypted passwords);</li>
  <li>Browsing data (IP address, pages viewed, date and time of connection, browser used, operating system, user ID, MAID);</li>
  <li>Economic and financial data (data relating to your bank cards);</li>
  <li>Any information you wish to send us as part of your contact request;</li>
  <li>Technical data relating to video calls: only connection metadata (duration, network quality) is processed to ensure service maintenance, in compliance with the strictest security standards (SOC2, HIPAA).</li>
</ul>

<p>To enable open conversations and ensure digital hygiene, SAPIOW guarantees the strict confidentiality of your exchanges through the secure infrastructure of its certified technical partner.</p>

<p>SAPIOW formally undertakes never to record the content of your video calls; no audio or video streams and no transcriptions are recorded.</p>

<p>Exchanges are encrypted in transit and are never stored on servers. There is no archive: once the video call has ended, the content permanently ceases to exist.</p>

<p>We have no interest in exploiting your data: it is never analyzed, never sold, nor used to train third-party technologies.</p>

<p>Mandatory data fields are indicated when you provide your data to us. They are marked by any appropriate means.</p>

<h2><strong>Is your data likely to be transferred outside the European Union?</strong></h2>

  <li>or the data is transferred on the basis of one of the appropriate safeguards described in Chapter V of the GDPR.</li>
